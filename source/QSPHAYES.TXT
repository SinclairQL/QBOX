                           QSPHAYES V1.00g2 NOTES
                           ----------------------

This archive file contains QSPHAYES v1.00 gamma 2, a much improved QSPIL
driver for Hayes-compatible modems. Here below follows a list (probably
incomplete!) of improvements with respect to the 0.99 versions:


v1.00g2 (19 August 1994)
------------------------

- Implemented a new function SP.DCD in QSPHAYES and IO.DCD in SERC_REXT,
  based on suggestions made by Lester Wareham. These allow for the
  automatic EOF on DCD loss to be disabled, as required in some FAX
  configurations. Updated QSPHAYES_DOC accordingly.

- Fixed a cosmetic bug (quirky menus) in QSPSETUP.

- Corrected some minor bugs in QSPHAYES and SERC_REXT.

- Included source now (except QSPSETUP). I don't expect many changes to occur
  between now and the final release (except for bugfixes of course).


v1.00g1 (25 March 1994)
-----------------------

- No less than ten (10) new possible baud rates. QSPHAYES now supports 300,
  1200/75, 1200, 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600,
  24000, 26400, 28800 and 38400 bps. Also, CONNECT FAX is recognised so that
  future QBOX versions can respond to an incoming fax call. Of course, all
  modem responses are configurable.

- It is no longer required to have the modem command echo off (ATE0). 
  QSPHAYES automatically filters out the local echo of its own commands.

- QSPHAYES can now recognise the "RINGING" response during dialling. It is
  effectively ignored though in the present version, but causes no harm now.

- The number of rings before QSPHAYES sends the answer command to the modem is
  now configurable.

- A new fully menu-driven configuration program has been written.

- QSPHAYES now handles the serial channel open and close operations
  differently, closing and re-opening it only when necessary. Also, the bug
  present in QBOX 1.19l which sometimes causes QBOX to go into a loop is now
  avoided.

The biggest improvement though will probably be the new manual included
within this archive, named QSPHAYES_DOC (and yes, it's a QUILL file!). This
contains detailed instructions how to set up QSPHAYES and your communication
equipment in general. Also, it provides a complete QSPIL technical reference.


IMPORTANT:
----------
As this version of QSPHAYES supports more baud rates than was documented in 
the original QSPIL standard, you must use it ONLY with the LATEST versions of
QBOX and MAIL!. At present, the latest version of QBOX is 1.19l, and the latest
version of MAIL is 1.19j. Later versions are OK, but earlier versions are not!
If you need to use an earlier version of QBOX/MAIL, you must ensure that
QSPHAYES will never report a "CONNECT" rate higher than 9600 bps. If you have a
faster modem, then configure the "CONNECT 9600" response as "CONNECT". This
causes any "unknown" connect string to be reported as a CONNECT 9600. Also, the
"Error Control" string (normally "/ARQ") must be changed to something which
cannot be reported as a string after "CONNECT xxxxx" by your modem. E.g. "ZZZ"
will probably do.
When dialling out, MAIL will always attempt to use the highest possible baud
rate (e.g. 28800). If this is undesirable, then make the "Dial Prefix" for all
baud rates higher than supported empty.

Well, that's it for now, remember if you don't understand something at first,
then "Read The Fine Manual"! If you are still convinced that you have found a
"bug", then please report it in the SYSOP.QBOX echomail conference. You can
also post any comments about this version there.
