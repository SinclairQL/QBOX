                       QBOX v1.19beta Revision History
                       -------------------------------

v1.19n   ?? ??? 1994
--------------------

- I've done great injustice to Lester Wareham's LFAX by saying that
  QFAX was the only fax program that could be run in conjunction with 
  QBOX. In fact, LFAX had this capability already from it's very first
  release (the commandline -p option)!
  So, here's an example fax program spec for LFAX:

  flp1_LFAX %< %>>log %> -p
  

v1.19m   21 Oct 1994
--------------------

- When the user disconnected the line during the initial "Press <ESC>
  for BBS" message, QBOX failed to close the serial channel. Subsequent
  attempts to open it failed because it was still open, and QBOX went
  into an endless loop... Although this bug could be circumvented in
  QSPHAYES, it is fixed now.

- Fixed a long-standing bug in the online message editor. When the user
  entered an invalid line number in response to the editor's Delete Line 
  command, QBOX would crash... (Reported by Tiago Freitas Leal).

- When a mailsession is aborted and resumed later, already sent files 
  are now not re-sent. They are "commented out" in the _ATT files by
  replacing the first character of the filename with ";".

- QBOX occasionally produced garbage REPLY-kludges. Also, when a
  message was updated, the REPLY-kludge was incorrect or lost. Fixed.

- When entering netmail or answering a mail session, QBOX now
  auto-selects its own address by matching up the remote's zone in the
  AKA list defined in QSETUP. If this zone cannot be found, QBOX uses
  its main address.

- It is now possible to set the buffer size used by the SEAlink 
  receiver. Previous versions automatically decided whether to use no
  buffer (when receiving was on RAM?_), a 32K buffer (when receiving on
  WIN?_) or an 8K buffer (when receiving on anything else). Now, you
  can configure this using QSETUP.
  The value you should choose depends much on your hardware equipment.
  It's best to experiment. If you have Hermes and you receive your
  files always on RAMdisk or a hard disk, you can safely try the "None"
  option as these are fast storage devices and serial overruns are not
  much likely to occur (and if they occur, they are quite harmless...).
  If you have Hermes, the "None" option may even be OK when using
  floppy's, although it will probably not be reliable when there is no
  flow control between modems (non-MNP or V42 connect) and throughput
  may degrade at higher speeds.
  When the "8K" or "32K" option has been selected, a buffer of the
  corresponding size is used to receive incoming files. When the buffer
  has been filled, the remote is told to temporarily stop the transfer
  (using the SEAlink MACFLOW feature) and QBOX writes out the contents 
  of the buffer to disk. This will degrade troughput, but is safer when 
  using floppydisks which tend to disable interrupts for quite a long
  interval when data is being written, which may upset serial I/O.
  You should try the 32K option first. If you experience problems when
  receiving (other end times out when QBOX flushes its buffer) then try
  the 8K option.

- SEAlink Overdrive (ACKless) is now configurable in QSETUP for both
  receive and send. When Overdrive is being used, the sender doesn't
  have to wait for acknowledging blocks altogether (except of course
  for the end-of-file). Note that this scheme is only enabled on
  error-free (MNP/V42) connects, and automatically negotiated between
  both ends.
  In general, SLO can give better file-transfer performance when using
  high-speed error-correcting modems since it doesn't have to wait for
  ACKs. Problems can occur though when slow, interrupt-consuming
  floppydisks are used for storage on the receiving end. In theory,
  this wouldn't be a problem when using Hermes and proper modem
  handshake, but some people have experienced problems even with
  Hermes. It is best to experiment, and if you do have problems when
  receiving using SLO there isn't much else you can do than to turn it
  off unfortunately.
  
- QSETUP now has a "Modem" menu. This effectively does the same as the
  "QSPSETUP" program supplied with the latest gamma versions of
  QSPHAYES, i.e. it allows you to configure the modem and serial port's
  parameters. A copy of QSPHAYES v1.00 gamma 3 is included within this
  archive.

- QBOX no longer has an inbuilt terminal emulator for local logons or
  chat mode. Instead, it calls an external terminal emulator program,
  the name of which is specified in the QSETUP Filenames menu.
  QBOX communicates with the terminal emulator program via two pipes,
  one for each direction. Thus, the terminal program must also be able
  to use pipes for its in- and output channels. To my knowledge, the
  only terminal emulator program which currently supports this is
  QLTerm. A copy of QLTerm v2.33 is included within the QBOX
  distribution archive. Be sure to set the filename of the terminal
  program correctly in the QSETUP Filenames menu!
  When you want to leave QLTerm out of local- or chat mode, press F3
  followed by Q.

- It is now possible to add command line parameters to the external
  message editor. Due to this change, the editor's filename is stored
  somewhat differently, so you have to re-enter it in the QSETUP
  Filenames menu. If you want to add any parameters, specify them after
  the program name, separated by a space. The macro '%W' inserts the
  name of the editor workfile (e.g. flp1_QED %W).

- QBOX now has the ability to execute a program, or a number of
  programs, after receipt of incoming mail or files using the "Mail
  processing" option in the QSETUP Mailer menu. It is now also possible
  to execute one or more programs after a user has logged off (see the
  Filenames menu in QSETUP). For more information on executing external
  programs, see the README_NOW file.

- And last but not least: QBOX now has FAX support! In the QSETUP
  Filenames menu, you can specify the name of a program to be executed
  when QBOX has got a FAX connect from your modem. NOTE: As of yet, I
  haven't been able to test this as I still only have one fax-capable
  modem (a ZyXEL U-1496E+). I have ordered a USR V.34 faxmodem so I
  will be able to test it in the near future. In the meantime, any
  comments and bug-reports on this feature are welcome.
  In order to be able to receive fax calls front-ended by QBOX, the
  external fax program must have a provision for the serial channel to
  be passed on from QBOX as a QDOS "stack channel". Both Jonathan
  Hudson's QFAX and Lester Wareham's LFAX have this capability (QFAX
  only from version 2.0 onwards).
  Two examples for the FAX program specification in QSETUP:

  flp1_QFAX %< %>>log %> -v -x -G
  flp1_LFAX %< %>>log %> -p

  (For more information on the "%" macros, refer to the "External
  Programs" section in the README_NOW file).
  In this example, the fax program will use the QBOX logfile for 
  logging messages. If you want it to send its messages to a separate 
  logfile, just replace "log" with the name of the logfile you desire 
  (note that you have to specify full QDOS filenames as default 
  directories are currently not recognised).
  One final note: If you encounter problems receiving fax calls, try
  executing the fax program from a RAMdisk.
  
  
v1.19l   12 Nov 1993
--------------------

- Fixed the SEAlink code again to work with QEM...

- The "Time left" value in the [S]tatistics menu never counted down to
  zero during the session. Fixed now.


v1.19k   08 Nov 1993
--------------------

- When QBOX was started up in Local mode (-L commandline option or defined
  in QSETUP), SuperBasic could get corrupted. Fixed.

- Yell mode was always off at startup regardless of the setting in QSETUP.
  Fixed now.

- The Change user settings menu now has an extra option [U]serlist (Cosysop
  level and higher). This is useful for a name search when you are not sure
  about the exact spelling; you can then lookup the possible names first from
  the userlist.

- Changed the way in which the time left for today is kept for each user.
  The byte at offset 99 in the USERS_BBS record is no longer used for storing
  the minutes left. Instead, the 2-byte word at location 80 is used for the
  number of minutes USED today. This eliminates the problem that the user's
  daily time limit doesn't get updated in the event of a security level change
  until the next day, and time limits higher than 255 minutes are now possible.
  There is one little drawback of this change: when you switch versions, all
  users will get their maximum time back for today!

- Extra menu option [S]tatistics in the MAIN, MAIL and FILES menu. This
  displays various useful time statistics to the user. The [S]can option in the
  MAIL menu has been renamed to [Y]our mail.

- It is now possible to alter the user's time left directly from the sysop's 
  panel. The left and right arrow-keys decrease and increase the time by 1 
  minute respectively; the down and up arrow keys decrease and increase it by 
  5 minutes respectively. This will only affect the user's time left for the
  current session, not the daily time limit.

- The security level of the user currently online can now be set from the
  sysop's panel. The change made will be permanent; the user's time limit will
  also be adjusted immediately.

- SEAlink now pads the last (incomplete) block with CTRL-Z's once again.

- Fixed a problem occurring when downloading with QEM using SEAlink. When the
  last file had been sent, QBOX sent an EOT character to signal the end of the
  batch transfer. QBOX didn't wait for acknowledgement of this EOT since this
  is not required in the FTS-0007 mail session protocol. However, QEM's SEAlink
  (which is based on the original SEAlink code from System Enhancement's
  Associates) responds to this EOT with a NAK to rule out the possibility of a
  premature end-of-batch due to a spurious EOT being received as line noise.
  Since QBOX didn't re-send the EOT, QEM kept waiting until it finally timed
  out (after a looong time :-().
  QBOX will now wait for acknowledgement for the final EOT, so this problem
  should be over now...

  
v1.19j   09 Dec 1992
--------------------

- The [R]aw dir command was accessible by any user with level >= NORMAL,
  rather than COSYSOP. Fixed.

- When no Mail-only time slot was defined, remote users had a time limit
  of only 10 minutes. Fixed.

- QSETUP_BBS remained open after loading until QBOX was quit. It is now
  closed immediately after QBOX has read it. Note however that changes
  made with QSETUP while QBOX is running will take effect only after QBOX
  is quit and restarted.

- There appears to be a bug in Qscan which leaves the point field in a
  FSC-0039 packet header non-zero after the point address has been remapped.
  E.g. the address "2:283/500.1" is remapped by Qscan to "2:7500/1.1"
  rather than "2:7500/1.0" when the pointnet is 7500. This resulted in QBOX
  not allowing this point to pick-up waiting mail since it treated the
  point part of the pointnet address as significant.
  As it is unlikely that Qscan will ever be fixed, I have adjusted the
  remapping code in QBOX in such a way that QBOX will ignore the point
  part of a pointnet address when looking for mail to pick-up.


v1.19i   07 Dec 1992
--------------------

- Drastically changed the way QBOX is configured. Read README_NOW for details!
  
- Finally implemented the Network Mail front-end. You can definitively throw
  away TempFront now!
  Also, the problems with TempFront related to running QBOX with "buried"
  windows under the Pointer Environment should be gone now. QBOX should always
  write to its screen window with a zero timeout.

- Added new download and upload protocols, Telink and SEAlink. These protocols
  can handle batch file transfers (i.e. multiple files in a single file
  transfer session). Support for external protocol drivers will be added in
  future betas.

- The [S]ysop menu no longer exists. Its options have been moved to the
  FILES menu in somewhat different forms.
  The [R]aw dir command will display the contents of the desired directory,
  and the [O]verride directory command allows you to switch to a different
  directory, so that you can use the [D]ownload and [U]pload commands to
  down- or upload files to the directory of your choice rather than the
  directory corresponding to the selected file area.
  The [R]aw dir and [O]verride directory commands are only available to
  users with security level COSYSOP or higher.

- NetMail areas are now designated by a /N switch in the MAREAS_BBS entry.
  Thus it is possible to have more than one NetMail area. Although the other
  netmail utilities support only one NetMail area, this may be useful for
  e.g. keeping sent or received NetMail messages.


v1.19h   26 Apr 1992
--------------------

- Fixed bug introduced in 1.19f that caused the file list display to go haywire
  on certain occasions.

- When a log-off message was saved, the log file entry indicated erroneously
  that it was saved in the user's current message area rather than the sysop
  message area.

- Removed "#" before area and message numbers of the "Saved message" log entry
  for consistency.


v1.19g   22 Apr 1992
--------------------

- Line input and (Y/N) functions sometimes had erratic behaviour, caused by old
  viewdata code which I forgot to remove.

- Some cosmetic changes made to the message attribute display.


v1.19f   18 Apr 1992
--------------------

- New option in MAIL menu: [X]port to file (cosysop or higher level required).
  Allows you to export the current message to a local device or file. If the
  file already exists, the contents of the message being exported will be
  appended.

- New option in EDITOR menu: [R]ead text from file (cosysop level or higher).
  Allows you to import a local text file into the message editor. The text file
  may contain CR/LF's at the end of each line or just LF's.
  If you import a message this way, the current contents of the editor buffer
  will be destroyed.

- New option in EDITOR menu: [H]andling (EXTRA level or higher). Allows you to
  change the attributes (e.g. Crash, File Attach) of the message currently
  being edited. Note that while it allows you to change almost all of the 
  attributes assigned by the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee, only some
  of the them are actually supported by the QBOX mail utilities (and mostly
  only in the Network Mail area).
  One useful attribute that is worth mentioning is the File Attach attribute.
  When this is set, the Subject field is treated as a list of files to be sent
  to the addressee along with the message. When the message is packed using
  Erik Slagter's Qscan program, an outbound _ATT file is automatically built 
  from the information in the subject line.

- QBOX can now generate its own tear- and Origin line in EchoMail areas.
  The text for the Origin line can be defined on a per-area or per-group basis
  or globally for all areas. This is done in the following order:

  - If the message area directory, as defined in MAREAS_BBS, contains a file
    called "ORIGIN", the origin line text will be taken from that file;

  - if there is a file "ORIGIN_<tag>" in the SYSTEM directory, the origin line
    text will be taken from that file. <tag> is the single-letter area group
    tag defined for that area in MAREAS_BBS; so if the current area has a tag A
    QBOX will look for a file ORIGIN_A;

  - If neither of the above files can be found, QBOX will look for a file
    "ORIGIN" in the SYSTEM directory. If this file is absent too, QBOX will NOT
    generate a tear- and origin line and will thus behave as previous versions.

  You can mix the above three forms in any way you like; if QBOX can't find a
  "local" ORIGIN file for the current area it will look for an ORIGIN_<tag>
  file, and failing that it will look for a global ORIGIN file.

  In any of the three forms, QBOX can generate a "randomly" chosen Origin-line.
  To allow this, simply put several lines into the ORIGIN-files. QBOX will
  randomly choose one of these lines as Origin-line for the current message.
  Be careful NOT to enter empty lines (especially at the end); otherwise you
  may get a message with an "empty" Origin-line (unless you really intended to
  do so!).

  NOTE: You should NOT enter your network address in brackets in the
  Origin-files; QBOX will automatically add this info (see also the /A option
  below). If the Origin line text together with the " * Origin: " keyword and
  network address doesn't fit into 79 characters (as required in EchoMail),
  QBOX automatically truncates the Origin line text so that the whole
  Origin-line will fit.

- And THIS is the feature you've been waiting for: a FULL-SCREEN SysOp message
  editor! You need to have a plain-text editor for this as QBOX simply calls an
  external editor to edit a temporary file (ram1_MSG_TMP), which is imported 
  back into the QBOX edit buffer after you have exited from the external 
  editor.
  The filename of the external editor (which should be EXECable) is specified
  using the QBOXCONFIG program. QBOX pushes the full QDOS name of the MSG_TMP
  file onto the command string of the editor before executing it, so if your
  editor can take its workfile name from the command string (my freeware QED
  editor is an example of this) the whole process can be automatic.

  When entering or replying to a message in local mode, you will now no longer
  be greeted by the boring QBOX line editor, but by a full-screen all-singing
  and dancing editor! In the unlikely event that you still want to use the
  normal line editor in local mode, simply leave the "External editor" field
  blank in QBOXCONFIG.
  When you have finished your message, exit the editor in the normal way (in
  QED with the 'X' command). QBOX will then read the edited message text into
  its normal editor (unless an error occurred when executing the external
  full-screen editor) and you can then List, Abort, Save etc. it as usual.

  NOTES:

  1. In the present version, the name ram1_MSG_TMP is hardcoded. This means
     that a RAMdisk is necessary to use the external editor. I've decided to do
     this because it's faster, and because older FLP drivers appear to have a
     bug when a file is overwritten and then immediately FS.LOADed from disk by
     QED (the first betatesters got the contents of the previously edited
     message rather than the current!). In future versions the temporary
     message file name will be configurable.

  2. It's best to use the Pointer Interface if you want to use the external
     editor, otherwise your screen may look a bit ugly after you have exited 
     from the editor...
  
- Added new MAREAS_BBS option: "/A=<address>". This allows you to define a
  different (alias) address per message area. Useful if you are a multi-network
  node or point. E.g. when having "/A=50:1000/4" in your MAREAS_BBS for that
  particular area, QBOX will use address 50:1000/4 in EchoMail Origin lines.
  NOTE: The current version of SCANMAIL (1.01b) does NOT support multi-network
  operations; it is however expected that newer versions will.

- New EDITOR menu option [F]rom (EXTRA level or higher). This allows you to
  change the default "From:" name, and network address if you are in the 
  Network Mail area.

- TWIT-level users can no longer enter the Change user settings menu.

- Fixed problem with display of "negative" Time-left values.

- A log file entry is now made when the user saves or aborts a message.

- Wildcards in the SYSOP menu [D]ir command now finally work.
     
- Local logon from sysop panel now user "L" key rather than "T".

- Fixed cosmetic bug causing "Waiting for call-back" to be displayed
  occasionally on start-up.

- [U]pdate message command now really works only with level EXTRA or higher!

- Fixed bug causing "bleed-through" of block message during file transfers.

- Fixed bug affecting local logons while another user logs on or off
  simultaneously.


v1.19d   14 Feb 1991
--------------------

- Fixed bugs in new/personal mail scan (new LOOKMAIL version)

- Fixed bugs affecting PRIVATE status of messages

- Entering an empty name in Change user settings no longer causes lockup

- Garbage is no longer displayed in status window during log-on procedure

- Chat mode now has wordwrap at end of line!

- Fixed bug that caused uploads to fail with "I/O Error" message

- File- and Sysop menu now return to Main with [Q]uit for consistency


v1.19c   10 Feb 1991
--------------------

- Fixed bug in reading of destination network address when entering NetMail
  message (now defaults correctly)

- Fixed bug in "To:" name / network address entry that caused a crash under
  certain circumstances

- Local logons now have no time limit and inactivity timeout


v1.19b   10 Feb 1991
--------------------

- First beta release since 1.14.
